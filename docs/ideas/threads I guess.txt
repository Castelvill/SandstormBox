What about running some layers in threads?

More exactly: forking every loop that iterates through layers and then objects.

Running collisions for threads could be good.
Running movement too

You could use a vector of BaseTriggers struct. Every instance of this struct could be executed in a different thread.
This would allow for running events in threads like this:
start thread1 false
primaryTrigger each_second 0 (thread 0)
if…
…
end
start thread2 false
primaryTrigger each_second 1 (thread 1)
if…
…
end

Of course this would be dangerous, but it’s a tool for smart people.
