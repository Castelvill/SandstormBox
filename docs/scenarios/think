1. Engine boot
2. Terminal
3. $ newproject project1
4. New window is opened in the fullscreen. You see default wallpaper and app icons: Terminal, Layers, Objects, Scripts, Modules, Bitmaps, Fonts, Settings.

Layers:
Layers list on the left - you can:
- change layers' order,
- add new ones,
- remove old ones
- hide and show layers,
- start and stop editing them.
The main camera takes the rest of the window. Hiding and showing layers removes and adds them to the camera visibility. Starting and stopping editing them adds and removes them from camera's accesibility list.
In the main camera you can:
- move objects around,
- create blank objects,
- clone objects from the current or other project,
- open the edit window for the objects,
- remove and duplicate objects,
- set up the grid.

Objects:
Opens the object selection window. You can create a new object or select exisiting one from this or other project and duplicate objects. All objects created in this window will be added to 'Template' layer. Selecting an object opens the object editor window.

Object editor:
Looks like a file manager. First thing you see is the list of modules (events are divided into scripts and events). Clicking a module takes you to the list of this module's instances. You can add and remove them. Clicking on the module instance other than of the script type  opens the module editor. If you select a script, a text editor will be opened.

Scripts:
Opens the list of scripts. You can create a new script or choose an existing one from this or other project. Clicking on the script opens the text editor.

Modules:
Opens the module selection window. After choosing a module you can create a new instance or an existing one from this or other project. You can also duplicate an instance. Selecting one opens the module editor. All module instances in the editor belong to template object in the special layer.

Bitmaps:
Opens the list of loaded bitmaps. You can add new images from your filesystem or remove old ones. All loaded bitmaps in the current session will be always reloaded after opening this project. You can rename the bitmaps or select one for the wallpaper.

Fonts:
Opens the list of loaded fonts. You can add new fonts from your filesystem or remove old ones. All loaded fonts in the cuurent session will be always reloaded after opening this project.
